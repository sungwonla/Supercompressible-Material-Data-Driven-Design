# Supercompressible-Material-Data-Driven-Design
Data-driven design of a supercompressible material (ENGN 2350 Final Project)

Various FEA simulations for a supercompressible material were performed with ABAQUS, with varying input parameters (both material and geometrical properties) and the resulting output values of critical buckling stress, maximum energy absorption, and coilability (discrete output). This data was used in various machine learning schemes to optimize the geometrical and material properties of the structure, yielding a coilable design with the highest critical buckling stress and maximum energy absorption values.
